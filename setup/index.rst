================================================
Setting Up the NVIDIA Drivers and CUDA Libraries
================================================

.. note::
    
    As a Linux user, I am going to focus on the installation and 
    setup process for a Linux Mint based computer. I prefer Mint because
    of its out-of-the-box driver support.


Linux Mint makes it easy to set things up.

To begin:

.. code::

    sudo apt-get install nvidia-384 nvidia-cuda-toolkit


And voila! We're done.

Pick an editor of your choice, I use Vim, and you're done.

Make sure that the drivers are the latest, I installed nvidia-384 as of this 
entry (check the git logs for the date), and I find that stuff works out of the box.
