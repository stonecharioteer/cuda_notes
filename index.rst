Welcome to Vinay's Notes on CUDA!

.. admonition:: Vinay

    I'm maintaining notes on CUDA through ``Sphinx`` because I seem to learn
    better with the assistance of exhaustive notes. I know this might take longer,
    but what do I have to lose?

CUDA is NVIDIA's C/C++ library to compile code that utilizes their GPUs.

.. note::

    All code in this documentation will be compliant for my current setup: an NVIDIA
    GEForce GTX 1060 3GB Graphics Card. I will be purchasing another card with 
    a different capability and structure later. Look at the page specifying the features
    of my GPU and their capabilities in this documentation.
